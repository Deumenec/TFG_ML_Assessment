In this sections, random amino acid sequences of different lengths were generated and their structures were predicted with AF3, for all structures, the model predicted fully ordered regions with fully defined secondary structures, which made no sense, 
In local clashes, the sequence EFRMYLLLVMA corresponds to a standard well studied alpha-helix, but as longer predictions are tried concatenating the helix to itself, AF3 outputs results which make no sense. For a 253 residue long helix there is no problem, predicting a linear helix. At 506 residues, the model predicts weird turns in the helix, beyond, with 1001 residues, unstable "hard turns" are predicted. Finally, with a 1992 residue long prediction, a globular shape is predicted for the whole structure, with sections of overlapping atoms. This displaying how, indeed, the model has not learned does not have physical constrains engraved in its architecture. The most curious part is that sections of overlapping atoms display a plDDT higher than 50. Such a behavior may indicate that the model struggles to predict elongated structures beyond a certain physical length.
