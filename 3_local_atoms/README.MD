This is a script to check distances between atoms in a given structure to find possible clashes. For a given element and structure, it computes the distance between each instance of the element and all other atoms inside of a cutoff radius. 

This simple program can help to look for clashes inside of the structure. One can also ask the program to raise a warning if it finds two atoms at close proximity and obtain the residue number of such atoms, or also exclude atoms from the same residue which are naturally bonding to each other.
