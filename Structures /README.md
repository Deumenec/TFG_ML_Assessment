This folder contains all structures used along the thesis. In generarl throughout this work,a name without sufix indicates that the structure is experimental while the suffix "_pred" indicates that a structure was predicted by AF3, following the steps descrived in the methods section. 

For all structures, the PDB file can be found in Raw_exp_structures and all AF3 predicted files in Raw_pred_structures. Raw_pred_all contains AF3 outputs. Afterwards, proteins were modified as descrived in the methods section, with the ready-to-be-compared structures being saved ready to be compared through all tests in Ready_structures.
