Comparsions of experimental vs AF3structures. In blue experimental structure while in organge the predicted one. And aligned through minimum. The TM-score values obtained through comparison are:

3qbi -> 1.182

6owe_mono -> 1.167

7f60 -> ---

7unl -> fix

7w1c -> 34.535

8vlw -> ---

9cah -> ---

Colors displayed as color cornflowerblue for experimental structure and orange red for AF3 prediction through UCSF Chimera.
